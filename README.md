# Alarm-Clock
## SENG 403 - Group Project
In	this	project	you	will	use	scrum	methodology	to	design	and	build	an alarm	clock in	a	group	of	six	
or	seven. This	project	has	four	deliverables that	are	worth	70	marks	in	total.
Contributions
Everyone	in	the	same	group	will	receive	the	same	mark	by	default.	However,	if	certain	members	
of	a	group	do	not	contribute	as	much	as	they	should	have,	their	marks	will	be	adjusted	according	
to	how	much	contributions	they	have	to	the	assignment.

### Descriptions
The project is comprised of four distinct components	(one	of	them	has	multiple	submissions)	and
every component is mandatory. If a group fails to complete one of the components,the group
members may each be assigned a mark of 0 for the entire project.
You	will	design	and	build	an	alarm	clock	with	scrum	methodology.	The	focus	of	the	project	is	on	
the	development	process.	Your	TA	will	be	your	customer	and	can	let	you	know	the	requirements	
of	the	alarm	clock.

### Deliverables
The	project	has	the	following	deliverables:
1. Materials	from	every	sprint	[30	marks]
    - There	may	have	five	(6	marks	each)	or	six	(5	marks	each)	sprints
    - Due	within	three	days	after	a	sprint	is	finished
2. Final	release	demo	[10 marks]
    - Demos will	be	done	near	the	end	of	the	term
3. Final	program	[15 marks]
    - Due	near	the	end	of	the	term
4. Final	report	[15 marks]
    - Due	near	the	end	of	the	term
  
Details	of	individual	deliverables	will	be	given	in	separate	documents.	It	may	become	necessary	to	
amend	this	project	specification	at	some	point.	If	that	is	the	case	you	will	be	notified	via	D2L.
